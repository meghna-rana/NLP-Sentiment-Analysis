# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis
The goal of this project is to identify customers' positive and negative reviews across various products and to develop a supervised learning model to polarise enormous volumes of data. Our data collection is made up of consumer reviews and ratings obtained from Amazon's Consumer Reviews. I analysed the accuracy of various models and gained a deeper picture of the' polarising opinions on the products.

DATASET:

The data is derived from the Amazon product reviews by the csutomers. It consists of 4915 data points and 10 columns(features).

METHODS:

Spacey and NTLK (Natural Language Toolkit) and their various libraries have been used for text analysis in this project. VADER and NRC Sentiment Intensity Analyzer from NLTK has been used for sentiment analysis.

I have also performed Topic Modelling on the Reviews using the libraries such as Gensim.

In NLP, topic modelling is a technique that assigns a subject to a corpus based on the words present. If a businessâ€™s receives hundreds of reviews, for example, it is critical for the company to understand which kind of evaluations are more significant and vice versa.
LDA, short for Latent Dirichlet Allocation. LDA proposes that the documents are formed via a statistical generative process, with each document consisting of a mixture of subjects and words.
